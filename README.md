# MNIST-Image-Detection
This machine learning program uses Python’s Keras library to create a Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network to detect hand-written numbers in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database. The program uses TensorFlow to generate readable data and creates a Neural Network of 5 epochs—it evaluates error over iterations until it is minimal. Using edge detection and enhanced array filtering, training and testing data is evaluated. This project utilizes Python machine learning and graphics libraries such as Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyPlot.
